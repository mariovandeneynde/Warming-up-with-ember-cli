Codeschool's Warming Up With Ember converted to Ember CLI

I finished the "warming up with ember" tutorial a few days ago. Now, I want to take this a step further and convert the solution (final step of the final level) to an Ember CLI application. This uses separate files and folder structure etc. 
Now I'm nearly there but it isn't working 100%... (just started working with Ember CLI :-) ).
Maybe the people who are interested, could chip in and build the codeschool example with Ember CLI, together.

# Step 1: Install Ember CLI

# Step 2: Create a new app
- create folder
- ember new 'my-app'
- go to the new 'my-app' folder
- copy the app and dist folder from github to your new app
- ember serve

end start coding :-)
